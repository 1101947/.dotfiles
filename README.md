I was interested in conception of placing personal settings on github known from https://github.com/erikdubois. I'm trying to switch to linux for 10 years and this time I'm going to start seriously.
Feel free to use if you find here something helpful.

- 01-install-i3-gaps.sh script automaticaly installs all dependencies and the latest git version of i3wm with gaps. It was sucsessfully tested on Linux Mint 18.3 XFCE, but also may work in other ubuntu- and may be debian-based distributions. *Please, read it's content before start it.*
