# Just my dotfiles and scripts

I was interested in conception of placing personal settings on github known from https://github.com/erikdubois. I'm trying to switch to linux for 10 years and this time I'm going to start seriously.
Feel free to use if you find here something helpful.

### About scripts

These scripts created and sucsessfully tested on Linux Mint 18.3 XFCE, but also may work in other ubuntu- and may be with some edits in debian-based distributions. *Please, read script's content before start it.*

- 00-install-config-git.sh script by default only installs git. To configure your git installation you should edit it. In future plans I want to make it asking for credetials during setup.

- 01-install-i3-gaps.sh script automaticaly installs all dependencies and the latest git version of i3wm with gaps.
